# Car Battery System - Hardware Design Documentation

This repository contains hardware design documentation for an advanced lithium-ion car battery system. The documentation covers all major subsystems including battery cells, battery management system (BMS), thermal management, electrical systems, and mechanical enclosures.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized in the `docs/` directory with the following structure:

- **core/** - Core battery components (cells, modules, BMS)
- **electrical/** - Electrical systems (charging, power distribution, monitoring)
- **mechanical/** - Mechanical and thermal systems (enclosure, cooling, connectors)

## Purpose

This documentation serves as a reference for the complete hardware design of a modern electric vehicle battery pack, including safety systems, thermal management, and intelligent monitoring capabilities.
